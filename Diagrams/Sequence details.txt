Sequence diagram
are type of UML diagram that show how objects in a system or classes within code interact with each other.
Particularly these diagrams show interactions in the order they take place in short they show the sequence of events
Actors : are always outside the system
Objects : represented by rectangle
Lifelines : are vertical dashed lines that show the existence of an object or actor over time
Messages : show the information being sent between objects, represented by solid line, this message isn't reply to any request
eg: insert card ---> atm
request pin <--- atm
Return message : represeneted by dashed lines (recieving object baack to requesting object) in short validation
eg: verify card ---> bank server
card ok <--- bank server
Alternative frame : symbolizes choice between two or more message sequence
eg : card is valid
card is not valid
Activation boxes : when and how long objects are active and idle
Note: actors are external hence they dont need activation boxes
