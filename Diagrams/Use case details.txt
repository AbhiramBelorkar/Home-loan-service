UML Use case diagram
Systems = website, software component, business process, application etc, represented by rectangle and put name on top, anything within in the rectangle happens within the app/website/software.
Actors = someone or somethingthat uses our system to achieve goal , actors are always put outside the rectangle eg: Person, organization, another system, external device, two types: primary and secondary actors
Primary actor: a person who initiates app, on the left side of rectangle eg: customer
Secondary actor: more Reactionary, on the right side of rectngle eg: Bank
Use case = represnts an action that accomplishes some sort of task within the system, in short what our system does, put inside the rectangle cz the actions will occur within the app/system. eg: login, check balance, transfer funds, make payments
Relationship = the actor will interact with use cases hence representing relations i.e association/include/extend/generalization
Include : 1. Base use case 2. Include use case
whenever a base use case is executed at same time include use  case should also excuted, drawn relationship by dashed lines eg: login(base class) verify password(include base clas)
Extend : 1. base use case 2. extend use case
when base use case is executed than at sometimes extend use case will execute based on some criteria, but not everytime, drawn by dashed line from extend to base eg: login(base) display login error (extend)
Generalization : inheritance, 
eg:
1. Make payment (general use case)
pay from checking and pay from savings (specialized use case)
2. Customer (general use case)
new customer and existing customer (specialized use case)
