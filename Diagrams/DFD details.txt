Data Flow Diagram
how data is processed by a system in terms of inputs and outputs, its focus is on the flow of information where data comes from, where it goes and how it gets stored.
Two types : 1. Yourdon and coad = for system analysis and design
(processes are rounded)
2. Gane and sarson = information systems (processes are squares/rectangles)
Process : transforms incoming data flow into outgoing data flow (circle/oval)
Datastore : repositories of data in the system (rectangle)
Data flow : pipelines through which packets of information flow (arrow)
External entity : objects outside the system with which the system communicates (rectangle)
Rules :
1. a process can connect to another process/external entity/datastore
2. two external entity cannot communicate with each other, same with datastore
3. external entity cannot directly communicate with datastore
